# Music Recommender using Machine Learning Model

For an online music store, when users sign up, a system will ask their age and gender and based on their profile, this model will recommend various music albums they're likely to buy.

In this project I use machine learning to increase sales. So I build a model,feed this model with some sample data based on the existing users. This model will learn the patterns in a given data and make predictions when a user signs up.

For instance, a system provide the model a new user's profile, what is the kind of music that this user is interested in, this model will say jazz or hip hop or whatever and based on that the system can make suggestions to the user.
